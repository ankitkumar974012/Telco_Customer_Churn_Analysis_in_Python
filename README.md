# Telco Customer Churn Analysis

### Introduction
In this project, I performed an end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. The goal was to gain insights from the dataset and prepare it for further analysis or modeling.

### Objective
The primary objective was to clean, explore, and visualize the data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships that could inform future decisions.

### Steps Taken in the Project
1. **Data Collection**:
   I began by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   I handled missing values, removed duplicates, and corrected data types to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis.

3. **Data Exploration**:
   I conducted descriptive statistics and created various visualizations, such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, to identify patterns and correlations within the data.

4. **Data Transformation**:
   I performed feature engineering and applied normalization and scaling techniques to prepare the data for modeling.

5. **Data Visualization**:
   Using Matplotlib and Seaborn, I created visualizations to summarize my findings and present the insights in an easily understandable format.

### Conclusion
Through this project, I was able to uncover key insights and patterns within the dataset. These findings can guide further analysis and decision-making processes. This project not only enhanced my data analysis skills but also demonstrated my ability to handle real-world data challenges effectively.
